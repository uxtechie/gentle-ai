# Release signing and key rotation

Gentle AI™ releases only when the protected `release` environment provides a real Minisign credential whose public key matches the trust anchors embedded in the binary. An unset, malformed, placeholder, or isolated test key stops both the updater and release workflow.

## User verification

1. Obtain the production Minisign public-key payload and its SHA256 fingerprint from a maintainer-controlled channel independent of the GitHub release assets.
2. Download `checksums.txt`, `checksums.txt.minisig`, and the archive from one exact `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` release.
3. Verify the signed identity before trusting any checksum:

   ```bash
   minisign -VQm checksums.txt \
     -x checksums.txt.minisig \
     -P "$GENTLE_AI_MINISIGN_PUBLIC_KEY"
   # Must print exactly:
   # repo=Gentleman-Programming/gentle-ai;tag=vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

   sha256sum --check --strict --ignore-missing checksums.txt
   ```

The public key is not secret, but its provenance is security-critical. A key fetched only from the release page cannot authenticate that same page.

## Provision the first signed release

> Maintainer-only boundary: this repository intentionally contains no production private key and no production public-key value.

1. Generate the production pair on a controlled maintainer system. The CI key must be unencrypted because the runner is non-interactive; GitHub's protected environment secret provides encryption at rest and access control.

   ```bash
   minisign -G -W -p gentle-ai-release.pub -s gentle-ai-release.key
   ```

2. Extract the base64 payload from line 2 of `gentle-ai-release.pub`. Publish that payload and a separately computed fingerprint through the project website or another maintainer-authenticated channel **before** publishing the first signed release.
3. Create or protect the GitHub Actions environment named `release`. Require appropriate reviewers and restrict it to protected stable-version tags.
4. Configure the public trust anchor as a repository Actions variable so the read-only preflight job can validate it. Configure the private key only inside the protected `release` environment:

   | Name | Kind | Exact value |
   |---|---|---|
   | `MINISIGN_PUBLIC_KEYS` | Repository Actions variable | One canonical Minisign base64 public-key payload; during rotation, exactly two distinct payloads separated by one comma, with no whitespace or trailing separator |
   | `MINISIGN_SECRET_KEY_BASE64` | Protected `release` environment secret | Base64 of the complete `gentle-ai-release.key` file |

5. Keep the existing `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` environment secret. Do not add the Minisign private key to repository variables, files, logs, artifacts, caches, or command-line arguments.
6. Run no release until `scripts/release-signing-preflight.sh` proves that the private key derives one configured public key, rejects the isolated test key, and signs/verifies an exact repository/tag canary.

The workflow validates the complete repository-variable value, exports a separate canonical value, and permits GoReleaser to inject only that validated output through this exact linker variable:

```text
github.com/gentleman-programming/gentle-ai/v3/internal/update/upgrade.releaseMinisignPublicKeys
```

Source/test builds retain `UNSET`; their binary self-updater refuses network replacement. There is no grace version and no unsigned fallback.

The updater caps a release archive at **128 MiB**. It rejects both oversized `Content-Length` declarations and chunked or otherwise unknown-length responses that cross the same ceiling, deleting partial downloads without changing the installed binary.

### Bootstrap existing installations

Binaries released before authenticated manifests cannot retroactively authenticate their first upgrade. For the first signed version, instruct existing users to download manually, verify the out-of-band public key fingerprint, verify the signed manifest and checksum, and then install. All later built-in upgrades are authenticated by the embedded trust anchor.

## Rotate without a trust gap

The runtime accepts at most two distinct keys to provide a bounded overlap:

1. Generate and publish the new public key and fingerprint out of band.
2. Publish a bridge release signed by the **old** private key with `MINISIGN_PUBLIC_KEYS=old,new`. Clients authenticate the bridge with the old key and receive both trust anchors.
3. Change the protected signing secret to the new private key. Publish subsequent releases with the same `old,new` overlap; signing preflight requires the new derived public key to be in that set.
4. After the supported upgrade window has passed, publish a release embedding only `new` and remove access to the old private key.
5. Revoke and securely destroy the old private key according to the maintainer incident process. Never reuse the isolated key under `internal/update/upgrade/testdata/`.

If a key may be compromised, stop releases. Do not silently replace a trust anchor or bypass the matching preflight; use an independently authenticated incident channel and require manual bootstrap when the old key can no longer sign a safe bridge.

## Release gates

### Release-note upgrade instruction

Every release note that tells users to replace or upgrade the binary must include this step:

```bash
gentle-ai sync
```

Never publish binary-only upgrade guidance. Managed reviewer and runtime assets are version-bound to the binary, and review lifecycle operations fail closed until sync repairs missing or mismatched writer provenance.

### macOS-only distribution

The release distributes only macOS `amd64` and `arm64` archives. The release
policy rejects any added Linux or Windows binary/archive, and the remote asset
verification accepts only the two macOS archives, provider contract, provenance,
and signed checksum manifest. The Linux release runner is publication
infrastructure: supported-platform tests run in macOS CI on the exact commit.

The tag workflow fails unless all of these hold:

- the event is an annotated exact `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tag;
- the event SHA, tag target, checkout, remote tag, and current `origin/main` are identical;
- the worktree and module graph remain immutable (`go mod tidy -diff`);
- macOS CI passes on the exact source commit and the tag preflight checks format;
- the protected signing key matches a non-test injected trust anchor;
- the macOS-only distribution policy passes before publication;
- GoReleaser signs the full `${artifact}` path with the exact trusted comment;
- the published GitHub asset set is exact, the remote signature is valid, and every remote checksum verifies.

<p><strong>Independent fork of <a href="https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/gentle-ai">Gentle AI</a>.</strong><br/>
This fork supports macOS and OpenCode v2 only. Other operating systems and AI agents are outside its support scope.</p>

Your agent writes code, then forgets everything. It has no opinion about your project,
and no way to prove what it did beyond asking you to read every line.
<strong>Gentle-AI gives it memory, a workflow, and evidence.</strong>

  HERO SLOT — the only animation on this page. Features is all still: four
  diagrams for the concepts, two captures as proof the thing runs. Motion is
  spent once, here, right after the pitch lands.

  Uncomment when docs/assets/features/hero-pi.gif exists. It is a real-time capture
  of the complete Pi startup: banner, extensions, skills and startup output, never
  trimmed. A stripped startup does not look like the real thing.

## Features

---

### Engram™ — Keep your project context

<img width="100%" src="docs/assets/diagrams/engram-memory.svg" alt="Three work sessions separated by a restart and by context compaction. Each break cuts the session layer but stops at the memory layer underneath. The first session saves a decision, the next one asks memory before asking you, and weeks later the same question is answered from memory instead of by re-reading the repository." />

The cost of a fresh session is not the tokens — it is you, re-explaining the same decisions every morning. Engram removes that: your agent writes down what it learns as it goes and reaches for it before it reaches for you, so context accumulates instead of resetting.

**[Docs →](docs/engram.md)**

---

### ODD — Keep small work small

<img width="100%" src="docs/assets/diagrams/odd-cycle.svg" alt="ODD authorizes and understands a request. Read-only work ends separately; authorized work stays lightweight when small or keeps a recoverable record when substantial, then is implemented, checked, and closed." />

Small changes should not need a planning pipeline, and larger work should not lose its context between sessions. **Organic Driven Development (ODD)** keeps understood changes lightweight and gives substantial, authorized work one recoverable feature document. The agent explores before changing code, checks the results, and keeps progress current so work can resume without rebuilding the plan.

**[Docs →](docs/usage.md#organic-driven-development-odd)**

---

### Strict TDD — Prove behavior when enabled

ODD uses the configured TDD mode and exact test runner. When Strict TDD is enabled, capture a failing behavior test before implementation, make it pass, then refactor while tests stay green. When disabled, run applicable functional checks anyway. The presence of tests alone does not enable Strict TDD.

**[Docs →](docs/usage.md#organic-driven-development-odd)**

---

### RDD — Check finished work at the right depth

<img width="100%" src="docs/assets/diagrams/rdd-review.svg" alt="How RDD checks a finished change. The exact change is frozen to a lineage, revision and target, then a read-only risk assessment picks the depth: passive gets a structural readback with zero reviewer lenses, medium gets one focused lens, high gets the canonical 4R — Risk, Resilience, Readability and Reliability. At most one bounded correction is allowed, and one exact acknowledgement closes the transaction. Delivery stays human-owned." />

Receipt-Driven Development (RDD) is on by default and opt-out: run `gentle-ai review mode disable` to turn it off. Explicit global or clone-local OFF choices remain OFF. Its point is that a review cannot drift: the candidate is frozen before anything reads it, so the evidence belongs to the exact version you are about to rely on — not to whatever the worktree looked like a moment later. The depth comes from that frozen candidate rather than from the model's judgment, and the result is informational. Commit, push and release stay your call.

**[Docs →](docs/review-integration.md)**

---

### Deterministic by design — Know the next valid step

<img width="100%" src="docs/assets/diagrams/deterministic.svg" alt="A different agent, a different model and a brand-new session all converge on the gentle-ai binary. It reads the change state from files on disk and returns the only valid next transition, so no model votes on what comes next. The answer is always one of four public states: Working, Checking, Ready, or Needs your decision." />

A model that guesses the next step guesses differently tomorrow, and differently again for your teammate. That is the gap between a workflow and a suggestion. The **`gentle-ai` binary** owns native RDD review transitions; ODD guidance keeps ordinary work proportional to the request. Review evidence is bound to the candidate rather than a model's recollection.

### OpenCode v2 — The supported agent

This fork focuses support on OpenCode v2 on macOS. Other integrations inherited from the upstream project are not supported here.

**[OpenCode integration →](docs/agents.md#opencode)**

## Get started

This fork is for macOS with OpenCode v2. The upstream Homebrew formula and installer install the upstream project, not this fork. To try this checkout locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uxtechie/gentle-ai.git
cd gentle-ai
go run ./cmd/gentle-ai install --dry-run
```

The dry run previews changes without installing anything. OpenCode v2 is this fork's support target; runtime compatibility has not yet been verified against v2. The source still contains an OpenCode v1 pin used by CI, so do not treat this scope statement as a v2 compatibility guarantee.

> **Local setup and prerequisites: [Quickstart →](docs/quickstart.md)** (some instructions there still describe upstream releases and other agents).
